              CHANGES IN seqdist2 VERSION 0.9-1 [2015-11-16]

New Functions
  o seqcost: proposes different ways of computing substitution
        (sm) and indel costs;
        returns a list with the two elements sm and indel.
  o seqsubm: alias of seqcost that returns only the substitution costs.
  o seqdist: new error message when 'refseq' is a state sequence object
      with an alphabet assigned different from that of 'seqdata' to it.

BUG FIXES
  o seqsubm, seqcost: option FUTURE wrongly returned a squared
        Chi-squared distance. This is now fixed.
  o seqdistOO: Now tests that a non NA value is provided
        for sm when method="OM".
  o seqdistOO: Restriction on the way to specify reference sequence
        as this was causing problem with some distance measures.
        Currently, it can only be the index of one of the
        sequence in the data.
  o SVRspell: Now SVRspell can compute distances to the NULL sequence
              (ie. a sequence of length 0)

              CHANGES IN seqdist2 VERSION 0.9

  o First development release
