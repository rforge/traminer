              CHANGES IN seqdist2 VERSION 0.9-1
BUG FIXES
  o seqdistOO: Restriction on the way to specify reference sequence as this was 
			   causing problem with some distance measures. Currently, it can only 
			   be the index of one of the sequence in the data. 
  o SVRspell: Now SVRspell can compute distances to the NULL sequence 
			 (ie. a sequence of length 0)
