\title{Distances (dissimilarities) between sequences}
\description{
  Computes pairwise dissimilarities between sequences or dissimilarity from
  a reference sequence. Several dissimilarity measures can be chosen, including
  optimal matching (OM) and many of its variants, distance based on the count
  of common attributes, and distances between sequence state distributions.

    When a state sequence object, it must contain a single sequence and have the same
    alphabet as \code{seqdata}.
    
    When a list, it must be a list of two sets of indexes of \code{seqdata} rows.
  }
  \item{norm}{

    The series of the substitution-cost matrices when an array and

    \code{"OMloc"}, \code{"OMslen"}, \code{"OMspell"}, \code{"OMstran"},

}
\details{
  The \code{seqdist} function returns a matrix of distances between sequences
  or a vector of distances from the reference sequence when \code{refseq} is set.
  The available metrics (see \code{method} option) include:
  \itemize{
    \item{
      \emph{Edit distances}: optimal matching (\code{"OM"}), localized OM
      (\code{"OMloc"}), spell-length-sensitive OM (\code{"OMslen"}), OM of spell
      sequences (\code{"OMspell"}), OM of transition sequences (\code{"OMstran"}),
      Hamming (\code{"HAM"}), dynamic Hamming (\code{"DHD"}), and the time warp edit
      distance (\code{"TWED"}).
    }
    \item{
      \emph{Metrics based on counts of common attributes}: distance based on
      the longest common subsequence (\code{"LCS"}), on the longest common prefix
      (\code{"LCP"}), on the longest common suffix (\code{"RLCP"}), on the number
      of matching subsequences (\code{"NMS"}), on the number of matching
      subsequences weighted by the minimum shared time (\code{"NMSMST"}) and,
      the subsequence vectorial representation distance (\code{"SVRspell"}).
    }
    \item{
      \emph{Distances between state distributions}: Euclidean (\code{"EUCLID"}),
      Chi-squared (\code{"CHI2"}).
    }
  }

  See \cite{Studer and Ritschard (2014, 2016)} for a description and the comparison
  of the above dissimilarity measures except \code{"TWED"} for which we refer to
  \cite{Marteau (2009)} and \cite{Halpin (2014)}.

  Each method can be controlled with the following parameters:

  \tabular{ll}{
    method \tab parameters \cr
    ------------------ \tab ---------------------------------\cr
    \verb{OM} \tab \verb{sm, indel, norm} \cr
    \verb{OMloc} \tab \verb{sm, expcost, context, norm} \cr
    \verb{OMslen} \tab \verb{sm, indel, link, h, norm} \cr

    \verb{TWED} \tab \verb{sm, (indel), h, nu, norm} \cr
    ------------------ \tab ---------------------------------
  }

  \code{"LCS"} is \code{"OM"} with a substitution cost of 2 (\code{sm = "CONSTANT",
  cval = 2}) and an \code{indel} of \code{1.0}. \code{"HAM"} is \code{"OM"} without
  indels. \code{"DHD"} is \code{"HAM"} with specific substitution costs at each
  position.

  \code{"HAM"} and \code{"DHD"} apply only to sequences of equal length.

  For \code{"TWED"}, the (single) indel serves only for empty sequences.
  The distance to an empty sequence is set as \eqn{n*}\code{indel}, where \eqn{n} is
  the length of the non empty sequence. By default (\code{indel="auto"}), indel is set
  as \code{2 * max(sm) + nu + lambda}.

  %%Currently, \code{"OM"} works only with sequences of equal lengths.

  When \code{sm = NULL}, the substitution-cost matrix is automatically created
  for \code{"HAM"} with a single substitution cost of 1 and for \code{"DHD"} with
  the costs derived from the transition rates at the successive positions.

  Some distances can optionally be normalized by means of the \code{norm} argument.
  Let \eqn{d} be the distance, \eqn{m} the maximum possible of the distance
  given the lengths \eqn{p} and \eqn{q} of the two sequences, and \eqn{k} the
  length of the longer sequence. Normalization \code{"maxlength"} is \eqn{d/k}
  (Abbott's normalization), \code{"gmean"} is \eqn{1-(m-d)/(p*q)^.5} (Elzinga's
  normalization), \code{"maxdist"} is \eqn{d/m}, and "YujianBo" is \eqn{2*d/(m+d)}.
  For more details, see  \cite{Gabadinho et al. (2009, 2011)}.
  Actually, to avoid negative outcomes, the length \eqn{p}, \eqn{q}, and \eqn{k} are
  set as (max) indel times the corresponding length. For some distances, \eqn{m} is
  only a possibly non-reachable upper bound.

  When \code{norm="auto"}, \code{"gmean"} is applied to \code{"LCS"},
  \code{"LCP"} and \code{"RLCP"} distances, \code{"maxlength"} is applied to \code{"OM"}, \code{"HAM"}
  and \code{"DHD"}, and the normalization "YujianBo" of \cite{Yujian and Bo (2007)} that preserves the
  triangle inequality is used in the other cases except \code{"CHI2"} and \code{"EUCLID"}. 
  For the latter two, the square of the 
  distances are normalized by the number of intervals and the maximal distance
  on each interval. Note that for 'CHI2' the maximal distance on each interval
  depends on the state distribution on the interval.

  When sequences contain gaps and the \code{left = NA}, \code{gaps = NA}, or \code{right = NA}
  option was passed to
  \code{\link{seqdef}} (i.e. when there are non deleted missing values), the
  \code{with.missing} argument should be set as \code{TRUE}. If left as
  \code{FALSE} the function stops when it encounters a gap. This is to make the
  user aware that there are gaps in the sequences. For methods that need an
  \code{sm} value, \code{seqdist} expects a substitution-cost matrix with a row
  and a column entry for the missing state (symbol defined with the \code{nr}
  option of \code{\link{seqdef}}). Substitution-cost matrices returned by
  \code{\link{seqcost}} (and so \code{\link{seqsubm}}) include these additional
  entries when the function is called with \code{with.missing = TRUE}. More
  details on how to compute distances with sequences containing gaps can be
  found in \cite{Gabadinho et al. (2009)}.
}
\value{
  When \code{refseq} is \code{NULL} (default), the whole matrix of pairwise
  distances between sequences or, if \code{full.matrix = FALSE},
  the corresponding \code{dist} object of pairwise distances between sequences
  is returned. When \code{refseq} is a \code{list} of two sets of indexes, the matrix
  of distances from the first set of sequences (rows) to the second set (columns). 
  Otherwise, a vector with distances between the sequences in the
  state sequence object and the reference sequence specified with \code{refseq}
  is returned.
