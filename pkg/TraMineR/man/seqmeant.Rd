\title{Mean durations in each state}
\description{
Compute the mean total time spent in each state of the alphabet for the set of sequences given as input.
}
\usage{
seqmeant(seqdata, weighted=TRUE, with.missing=FALSE, prop=FALSE, serr=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{seqdata}{a sequence object as defined by the \code{\link{seqdef}} function.}
  \item{weighted}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, the weights (weights attribute) attached to the sequence object are used for computing weighted mean total time.}
  \item{with.missing}{logical: if set to \code{TRUE}, cumulated durations are also computed for the missing status (gaps in the sequences). See \link{seqdef} on options for handling missing values when creating sequence objects.}
  \item{prop}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, proportions of time spent in each state are returned instead of absolute values. This option is especially useful when sequences contain missing states, since the sum of the state durations may not be the same for all sequences.}
  \item{serr}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, the variance and standard deviation of the total time spent in the states, as well as the standard error of the mean are also computed.}

\value{
An object of class \emph{stslist.meant}. There are \code{print} and \code{plot} methods for such objects.
}

\seealso{\code{\link{plot.stslist.meant}} for basic plots of \emph{stslist.meant} objects and \code{\link{seqmtplot}} (\code{\link{seqplot}} with \code{type="mt"}) argument for more sophisticated plots of the mean durations allowing grouping and legend.}
