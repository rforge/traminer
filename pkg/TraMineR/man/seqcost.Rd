\title{Generate substitution and indel costs}

\description{
The function \code{seqcost} proposes different ways to generate substitution costs
(supposed to reflect state dissimilarities) and possibly indel costs. Proposed methods are:
\code{"CONSTANT"} (same cost for all substitutions), \code{"TRATE"} (derived from the observed transition rates), \code{"FUTURE"} (Chi-squared distance between conditional state distributions \code{lag} positions ahead), \code{"FEATURES"} (Gower distance between state features), \code{"INDELS"}, \code{"INDELSLOG"} (based on estimated indel costs).
The substitution-cost matrix is intended to serve as \code{sm} argument in the \code{\link{seqdist}} function that computes distances between sequences. \code{seqsubm} is an alias that returns only the substitution cost matrix, i.e., no indel.
 }

\details{
The substitution-cost matrix has dimension \eqn{ns*ns}, where
\eqn{ns} is the number of states in the \link{alphabet} of the
sequence object. The element \eqn{(i,j)} of the matrix is the cost of
substituting state \eqn{i} with state \eqn{j}. It defines the dissimilarity between the states \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}.

With method \code{CONSTANT}, the substitution costs are all set equal to the \code{cval} value, the default value being 2.

With method \code{TRATE}
(transition rates), the transition probabilities between all pairs of
states is first computed (using the \link{seqtrate} function). Then, the
substitution cost between states \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} is obtained with
the formula

 \deqn{SC(i,j) = cval - P(i|j) -P(j|i)}

where \eqn{P(i|j)} is the probability of transition from state \eqn{j} to
\eqn{i} \code{lag} positions ahead.

With method \code{FUTURE}, the cost between \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} is the Chi-squared distance between the vector (\eqn{d(alphabet | i)}) of probabilities of transition from states \eqn{i} and
\eqn{j} to all the states in the alphabet \code{lag} positions ahead:

 \deqn{SC(i,j) = ChiDist(d(alphabet | i), d(alphabet | j))}


With method \code{FEATURES}, each state is characterized by the variables \code{state.features}, and the cost between \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} is computed as the Gower distance between their vectors of \code{state.features} values.

With methods \code{INDELS} and \code{INDELSLOG}, values of indels are first derived from the state relative frequencies \eqn{f_i}. For \code{INDELS}, \eqn{indel_i = 1/f_i} is used, and for \code{INDELSLOG}, \eqn{indel_i = \log[2/(1 + f_i)]}{indel_i = log[2/(1 + f_i)]}.
Substitution costs are then set as \eqn{SC(i,j) = indel_i + indel_j}.

For all methods but \code{INDELS} and \code{INDELSLOG}, the indel is set as \eqn{\max(sm)/2}{max(sm)/2} when \code{time.varying=FALSE} and as \eqn{1} otherwise.

\usage{
seqcost(seqdata, method, cval = NULL, with.missing = FALSE, miss.cost = NULL,
  time.varying = FALSE, weighted = TRUE, transition = "both", lag = 1,
  miss.cost.fixed = NULL, state.features = NULL, feature.weights = NULL,
  feature.type = list(), proximities = FALSE)

\arguments{
  \item{seqdata}{A sequence object as returned by the \link{seqdef} function.}

  \item{method}{String. How to generate the costs. One of \code{"CONSTANT"} (same cost for all substitutions), \code{"TRATE"} (derived from the observed transition rates), \code{"FUTURE"} (Chi-squared distance between conditional state distributions \code{lag} positions ahead), \code{"FEATURES"} (Gower distance between state features), \code{"INDELS"}, \code{"INDELSLOG"} (based on estimated indel costs).}

  \item{cval}{Scalar. For method \code{"CONSTANT"}, the single substitution cost. \cr
  For method \code{"TRATE"}, a base value from which transition probabilities are subtracted.\cr
  If \code{NULL}, \code{cval=2} is used, unless \code{transition}
  is \code{"both"} and \code{time.varying} is \code{TRUE}, in which case \code{cval=4}.}

    \item{with.missing}{Logical. Should an additional entry be added in the matrix for the missing states?
    If \code{TRUE}, the \sQuote{missing} state is also added to the state alphabet. Use this if you want to compute
    distances with gaps (non deleted missing values) inside the sequences. See \cite{Gabadinho et al. (2010)} for more details on the options for handling missing values when creating state sequence objects.}

    \item{miss.cost}{Scalar or vector. Cost for substituting the missing state. Default is \code{cval}.}

    \item{miss.cost.fixed}{Logical. Should the substitution cost for missing be set as the \code{miss.cost} value. When \code{NULL} (default) it will be set as \code{FALSE} when \code{method = "INDELS"} or \code{"INDELSLOG"}, and \code{TRUE} otherwise.}

    \item{time.varying}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} return an \code{\link{array}} with a distinct matrix for each time unit. Time is the third dimension (subscript) of the returned array.}

    \item{weighted}{Logical. Should weights in \code{seqdata} be used when applicable?}

    \item{transition}{String. Only used if \code{method="TRATE"} and \code{time.varying=TRUE}. On which transition are rates based? Should be one of \code{"previous"} (from previous state), \code{"next"} (to next state) or \code{"both"}.}

    \item{lag}{Integer. For methods \code{TRATE} and \code{FUTURE} only. Time ahead to which transition rates are computed
    (default is \code{lag=1}).}

    \item{state.features}{Data frame with features values for each state.}
    \item{feature.weights}{Vector of feature weights with length equal to the number of columns of \code{state.features}.}
    \item{feature.type}{List of feature types. See \code{\link[cluster]{daisy}} for details.}
    \item{proximities}{Logical: should state proximities be returned instead of substitution costs?}
    \item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{seqcost}}
}

\value{
  For \code{seqcost}, a list of two elements, \code{indel} and \code{sm} or \code{prox}:
    \item{indel}{
      The indel cost. Either a scalar or a vector of size \eqn{ns}.
    }
    \item{sm}{
      The substitution-cost matrix when \code{proximities = FALSE} (default).
    }
    \item{prox}{
      The state proximity matrix when \code{proximities = TRUE}.
    }
    \code{sm} and \code{prox} are a matrix of size \eqn{ns * ns}, where \eqn{ns}
    is the number of states in the alphabet of the sequence object.

  For \code{seqsubm}, only one element, the matrix \code{sm}.
