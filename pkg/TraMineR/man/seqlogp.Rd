\title{
Logarithm of the probabilities of state sequences
}
\description{
Logarithm of the probabilities of state sequences. The probability of a sequence is defined as the product of the probabilities of the successive states in the sequence. State probabilities can either be provided or be computed with one of a few basic models.

\usage{
seqlogp(seqdata, prob="trate", time.varying=TRUE,
        begin="freq", weighted=TRUE, with.missing=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
	\item{seqdata}{A state sequence object as produced by \code{\link{seqdef}}.}
	
	\item{prob}{String or numeric array. If a string, either \code{"trate"} or \code{"freq"} to select a probability model to compute the state probabilities. If a numeric array, a matrix or 3-dimensional array of transition probabilities. See details.}
	
	\item{time.varying}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the probabilities (transitions or frequencies) are computed separately for each time \eqn{t} point.}
	
	\item{begin}{String of numeric vector. Distribution used to determine the probability of the first state. If a vector, the probabilites to use. If a string, either \code{"freq"} or \code{global.freq}. With \code{freq}, the observed distribution at first position is used. If \code{global.freq}, the overall distribution is used. Default is \code{"freq"}.}
	
	\item{weighted}{Logical. Should we account for the weights when present in \code{seqdata}? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

  \item{with.missing}{Logical. Should non void missing states be treated as regular values? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\details{
The sequence likelihood \eqn{P(s)} is defined as the product of the probability with which each of its observed successive state is supposed to occur at its position.
Let \eqn{s=s_{1}s_{2} \cdots s_{\ell}}{s=s_1s_2 ... s_l} be a sequence of length \eqn{\ell}{l}. Then
\deqn{
	P(s)=P(s_{1},1) \cdot P(s_{2},2) \cdots P(s_{\ell},\ell)
}{
	P(s)=P(s_1, 1) * P(s_2, 2) * ... * P(s_l, l)
}
with \eqn{P(s_{t},t)}{P(s_t,t)} the probability to observe state \eqn{s_t} at position \eqn{t}.

There are different ways to determine the state probabilities \eqn{P(s_t,t)}. The method is chosen by means of the \code{prob} argument.

With \code{prop = "freq"}, the probability \eqn{P(s_{t},t)}{P(s_t,t)} is set as the observed relative frequency at position \eqn{t}. In that case, the probability of does not depend on the probabilities of transition. Here again, the relative frequencies can be computed over the entire covered period (\code{time.varying=FALSE}) or separately for each position \eqn{t} (\code{time.varying=TRUE}).


Option \code{prop = "trate"} assumes that each \eqn{P(s_t,t)}, \eqn{t>1} is set as the transition probability \eqn{p(s_t|s_{t-1})}{p(s_t|s_(t-1))}. The state distribution used to determine the probability of the first state $s_1$ is set by means of the \code{begin} argument (see below).
With \code{time.varying=FALSE}, the transition probabilities are assumed to be constant over the successive positions and  are estimated over the entire sequence duration, ie from all observed transitions. With \code{time.varying=TRUE}), the transition probabilities are estimated separately at each position, yielding an array of transition matrices. 

Custom transition probabilities can be provided by passing a matrix or a 3-dimensional array as \code{prob} argument.

The distribution used at the first position is set by means of the \code{begin} argument. You can either pass the distribution (probabilities of the states in the alphabet including the missing value when \code{with.missing=TRUE}), or specify \code{"freq"} for the observed distribution at the first position, or \code{global.freq} for the overall state distribution.


The likelihood \eqn{P(s)} being generally very small, \code{seqlogp} returns \eqn{-\log P(s)}{-log(P(s))}. The latter quantity is minimal when \eqn{P(s)} is equal to \eqn{1}.
