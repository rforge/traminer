\title{Check if sequences are in the compressed or extended format}
\description{Check whether \emph{seqdata} contains sequences in the compressed format (as character strings with states separated by a separator) or in the extended format (sequences stored in a matrix with each successive state in a separate column.) For a more detailed description of the compressed and extended format, see \cite{Gabadinho, 2009}.
}
\details{
Whether the sequence(s) are in compressed format is checked by counting the number of columns and searching for the \code{'-'} or \code{':'} separator. The function returns the separator if it has been found in the data. If the data contains more than one column, the data is supposed to be in the extended format, and \code{'X'} is returned, unless some state codes contain the \code{'-'} character (e.g., states coded with negative integer values), in which case \code{'-X'} is returned.
