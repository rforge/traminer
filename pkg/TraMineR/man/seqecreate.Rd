\title{Create event sequence objects.}
\description{
  Create an event sequence object either from time stamped events or from a state sequence object.
}
\details{
  There are several ways to create an event sequence object. The first one is by providing the events in TSE format (see \code{\link{seqformat}}), i.e. by providing three paired lists: id, timestamp and event, such that each triplet (id, timestamp, event) defines the event that occurs at time timestamp for case id. Several events at the same time for a same id are allowed. The lists can be provided with the arguments \code{id}, \code{timestamp} and \code{event}. An alternative is by providing a data frame as \code{data} argument in which case the function takes the required information from the "id", "timestamp" and "event" columns of that data frame. In any case with TSE format, \bold{listed events should be  grouped by id} and an error will be thrown otherwise. Such grouping can be achieved by ordering the data according to the id column using the \code{\link{order}} function (e.g., \code{data[order(data$id), ]}).

  The other way is to pass a state sequence object (as \code{data} argument) and to perform an automatic state-to-event conversion. The simplest way to make a conversion is by means of a predefined method (see \code{\link{seqetm}}), such as \code{"transition"} (one distinct event per possible transition), \code{"state"} (a new event for each entering in a new state) and \code{"period"} (a pair of events, one start-state event and one end-state event for each found transition).  For a more customized conversion, you can specify a transition matrix in the same way as in \code{\link{seqformat}}. Function \code{\link{seqetm}} can help you in creating your transition matrix.

  Event sequence objects as created by \code{seqecreate} are required by most other '\code{seqe}' methods, such as \code{\link{seqefsub}} or \code{\link{seqeapplysub}} for example.
%  A subsequence can be created using \code{seqecreatesub}, in which case \code{timestamp} is only used to detect simultaneous events (same time).

\usage{
seqecreate(data = NULL, id = NULL,timestamp = NULL, event = NULL,
  end.event = NULL, tevent = "transition", use.labels = TRUE,
  weighted = TRUE, endEvent)
%  seqecreatesub(timestamp, event)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{A state sequence object (see \code{\link{seqdef}}) or a data frame }
  \item{id}{The sequence 'id' (integer) column when data are provided in TSE format (ignored if \code{data} argument is provided).}
  \item{timestamp}{The event 'timestamp' (double) column when data are provided in TSE format, i.e., the time at which events occur (ignored if \code{data} argument is provided).}
  \item{event}{The 'event' column when data are provided in TSE format, i.e., the events occurring at the specified time stamps  (ignored if \code{data} argument is provided).}
  \item{end.event}{If specified this event indicates the end of observation time (total length of event sequences) when it is not followed by any other valid event. The event is ignored when occurring in between two valid events.}
  \item{tevent}{Either a transition matrix or a method to generate events from state sequences (see \code{\link{seqetm}}). Used only when \code{data} is a state sequence object.}
  \item{use.labels}{If \code{TRUE}, transitions names are built from long state labels rather than from the short state names of the alphabet.}
  \item{weighted}{If \code{TRUE} and \code{data} is a state sequence object, use the weights specified in \code{data} (see \code{\link{seqdef}})}
  \item{endEvent}{Deprecated. Use \code{end.event} instead.}
