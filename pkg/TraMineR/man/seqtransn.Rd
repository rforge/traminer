\title{Number of transitions in a sequence}
\description{
Computes the number of transitions in each sequence of a sequence object.
}
\usage{
seqtransn(seqdata, with.missing=FALSE, norm=FALSE, pweight=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
	\item{seqdata}{a state sequence object as defined by the
\code{\link{seqdef}} function.}
	\item{with.missing}{logical. if set as \code{TRUE}, missing states (gaps
in sequences) are considered as an additional state and included in
the DSS sequence. See \code{\link{seqdss}}.}
	\item{norm}{logical. If set as \code{TRUE}, the number of transitions is
divided by its theoretical maximum, the length of the sequence minus
1. When length of the sequence is 1, normalized value is set to 0 as in the non-normalized case.}
	\item{pweight}{logical. EXPERIMENTAL! If set as \code{TRUE}, when counting transitions
	each transition does not account for 1 but for its probability (transition rate) as observed in the data.}

 }

\details{A transition in a sequence is a state change between
time/position \eqn{t} and \eqn{t+1}. For example, the sequence
\code{"A-A-A-A-B-B-A-D-D-D"} contains 3 transitions. The maximum
number of transitions a sequence can contain is \eqn{\ell-1}{l-1}
where \eqn{\ell}{l} is the length of the sequence. The number of
transitions is obtained by subtracting 1 to the length of the the
Distinct Successive State (DSS) sequence. }

\value{a state sequence object containing the number of transitions
of each sequence in the object given as argument.}

\examples{
## Creating a sequence object from columns 13 to 24
## in the 'actcal' example data set
data(actcal)
actcal.seq <- seqdef(actcal,13:24)

## Computing the number of transitions
actcal.trans <- seqtransn(actcal.seq)

## Displaying the DSS for the first 10 sequences
actcal.trans[1:10]

## Example with with.missing argument
data(ex1)
ex1.seq <- seqdef(ex1, 1:13)

seqtransn(ex1.seq)
seqtransn(ex1.seq, with.missing=TRUE)
