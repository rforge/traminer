\title{Lengths of event sequences}
\description{
The length of an event sequence is its time span, i.e., the total time of observation. This information is useful to perform for instance a survival analysis. The function
\code{seqelength} retrieves the lengths of the provided sequences, while
\code{seqelength <-} sets the length of the sequences.
}
\usage{
seqelength(s)
seqelength(s) <- value
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{s}{An event sequence object (\code{seqelist}).}
  \item{len}{A list of sequence lengths.}
  \item{value}{A list of sequence lengths.}
}
\value{
  A numeric vector with the lengths of the sequences.
