  \subsection{Bug Fixes:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqdist()}: when \code{refseq} was passed as a state sequence
      object wrong results were sometimes returned.
      \code{seqdist()}: CHI2 and EUCLID distances were computed using
      counts instead of proportions.
    }
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 2.0-9 [2018-08-20]}{

  \subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqplot()} now supports the \code{ncol} argument for controlling the number of columns in the color legend.
      \item
      \code{seqdef()}: new argument \code{tick.last} to set the \code{tick.last} attribute of the state sequence object. Default is \code{tick.last = FALSE} to preserve the previous behavior.
      \item
      \code{plot.stslist()}, \code{plot.stslist.freq()}, \code{plot.stslist.statd()}, \code{plot.stslist.modst()}, \code{plot.stslist.rep()} (i.e. also \code{seqplot} with type \code{"i"}, \code{"I"}, \code{"f"}, \code{"d"}, \code{"Ht"}, \code{"ms"}, or \code{"r"}), and \code{plot.seqdiff()}: new argument \code{tick.last} that when set as \code{TRUE} allows to enforce a tick mark at the last position on the time x-axis. Has no effect when the last position is 1 + a multiple of \code{xtstep}. Default is to use the \code{tick.last} attribute of the state sequence object.
      \item
      \code{seqformat()}:
      \itemize{
        \item
        For \code{from = "SPELL"} and \code{process = FALSE}, \code{pdata = "auto"} is now equivalent to \code{NULL} instead of raising an error. Also, using argument \code{pvar} with \code{pdata = NULL} now raises a warning instead of an error and \code{pvar} is simply ignored.
        \item
        For \code{from = "SPELL"} an error is raised when columns referred to
        by \code{begin} and \code{end} are of class "Date".
        Integer values are expected.
        \item
        When \code{from = "SPELL"} or \code{to = "SPELL"}, an error is raised
        when the birth year column of \code{pdata} is of class "Date".
        Integer values are expected.
      }
      \item
      \code{seqplot()}: for \code{type = "r"} (\code{seqrplot}), an error is raised when
      a group has less than two cases.

    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug fixes:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqformat()}: An unneeded warning was raised when data
        was a matrix with a single string element.

      \item
      \code{seqdef()}: Bad handling of \code{missing} argument when
      \code{informat = "SPS"} or \code{"SPELL"}.

    }
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 2.0-8 [2018-01-26]}{

  \subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqcost()}: argument \code{miss.cost.fixed} is now \code{NULL} by
      default and will be set as \code{FALSE} when \code{method = "INDELS"} or
      \code{"INDELSLOG"}, and as \code{TRUE} otherwise.
      \item
      \code{seqpcplot()}: new logical \code{weighted} argument to control
      whether weights should be used or not.
    }
  }

  \subsection{Bug fixes:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqrplot()} and \code{seqplot(..., type="r", ...)}: the \code{method}
      and other related arguments for computing the \code{diss} matrix when the
      later was not provided was not recognized.
      \item
      \code{seqplot()}: Fixed some unused argument issues.
    }
  }

  \subsection{Misc:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      Vignette: Suppressed the loading of two unused LaTeX packages
      (subfigure and afterpage) that prevented the vignette to be built
      under OSX.
      \item
      Declaring use of C++11 for log1p: \code{SystemRequirements: C++11} declaration
      in \code{DESCRIPTION} and \code{math.h} header in \code{NMSdistance.cpp}
      \item
      Internal function \code{checkargs()} renamed as \code{TraMineR.check.depr.args()}
      and made public for use in \code{TraMineRextras}.
    }
  }
}


\section{Changes in version 2.0-7 [2017-08-15]}{
  \subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{alphabet()}: the get form now also applies to event sequences.
      In addition, an error is now raised when the argument is not a state sequence object, an event sequence object, or a probabilistic suffix tree (see the PST package for the latter).
      \item
      \code{seqdecomp()}: the \code{miss} argument can now also be a vector, e.g. \code{miss = c("*", "\%")}
      \item
      \code{seqformat()} has a new \code{right} argument to be used with
      \code{to = 'SPELL'}. The default \code{right = 'DEL'} suppresses the end spells of missing values. Set \code{right = NA} to keep the end spells of missing values.
      \item
      \code{seqdef()} now raises an error message when \code{void} is not a character different from \code{left}, \code{gaps}, and \code{right}.
      \item
      \code{seqtrate()} gains a new argument \code{count}. When \code{count = TRUE}, the function returns counts of transitions instead of transition probabilities.
    }
  }

  \subsection{Bug fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqpcplot()}:
      Due to a change in the R \code{tapply} function, option \code{ltype="non-embeddable"} did no longer work.
      \item
      \code{seqefsub()} with non-null \code{str.subseq} argument:
       multiple partial matches between events in \code{str.subseq} and the alphabet of events of
      the \code{eseq} event sequence object crashed the R session. Fixed by a change in the internal \code{seqecreatesub} function.
      \item
      \code{seqformat()}: \code{to="TSE"} and \code{to="SPELL"} produced errors or unexpected results in presence of missing and/or void states. Now, when \code{to = "SPELL"}, the missing and void codes are both converted to \code{NA} before conversion while they are kept as is when \code{to = "TSE"}.
      \item
      \code{seqetm()} produced an error in presence of void elements.
      \item
      An error occurred in the internal \code{implicativestat} function when a same condition subsequence was present in all subsequences.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Misc:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      Documentation of \code{seqformat()} and \code{seqecreate()}: added examples of the handling of missings in conversion into TSE and SPELL format.
    }
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 2.0-6 [2017-06-17]}{
  \subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqformat()}:
      \itemize{
        \item
        Redesigned version of the function with a new extensible, robust and documented
        implementation.
        \item
        Rewritten documentation with argument types, default values, scopes and
        detailed explanations.
        \item
        Added and generalized conversion to \code{"SPELL"} from TraMineRextras;
        added a \code{with.missing} argument specifically for this conversion.
        \item
        Added the possibility to pass directly the unique individual IDs (row names)
        of the input sequences with \code{id} when converting to \code{"TSE"}.
        \item
        Clarified the meaning of the \code{id} argument and changed its position in the
        list of arguments to reflect this.
        \item
        Changed the default value of the \code{id}, \code{begin}, \code{end}, and
        \code{status} arguments (now \code{"SPELL"} oriented).
        \item
        Renamed \code{compressed} argument as \code{compress} to avoid
        confusion (here it applies to the output, not to input data).
        \item
        Renamed \code{nr} argument as \code{missing} to avoid confusion (here
        it specifies the code to consider as missing values in input data,
        which is not the TraMineR internal code for missing values in state
        sequence objects).
        \item
        Adapted function calls to match the renamed argument names
        (\code{compressed}, \code{nr}) and the new input type checking (ie.
        single strings are deprecated).
        \item
        See the updated documentation of \code{seqformat()} for details.
      }
      \item
      \code{SPS_to_STS()}: renamed \code{nr} argument as \code{missing} to match
      \code{seqformat()} argument names renaming.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug fixes:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      \code{seqformat()}:
      \itemize{
        \item
        From \code{"SPELL"} to \code{"TSE"}: output IDs were incorrect.
        \item
        From \code{"SPELL"} to \code{"STS"}: states not appearing in the
        data were dropped from the output column levels.
      }
    }
  }
  \subsection{Misc:}{
    \itemize{
      \item
      Added new internal helper functions:
      \itemize{
        \item
        \code{msg.warn0()}: same as the existing \code{msg.warn()} but without
        white space insertion.
        \item
        \code{is.positive.integers()}: check if an object is a vector of
        positive integers.
        \item
        \code{is.a.character()}: check if an object is a (unique) character.
        \item
        \code{is.a.string()}: check if an object is a string.
        \item
        \code{is.strings()}: check if an object is a vector of strings.
        \item
        \code{is.index()}: check if an object is a positive integer or a string.
        \item
        \code{is.indexes()}: check if an object is a vector of positive integers
        or strings.
        \item
        \code{checkindex()}: check if an object is a valid data frame or matrix
        index; otherwise, an error is raised and an information message is
        displayed.
        \item
        \code{checkindexes()}: check if an object is a vector of valid data
        frame or matrix indexes; otherwise, an error is raised and an information
        message is displayed.
      }
      \item
      Grouped internal \code{is.xxx} helper functions into a single
      TraMineR-is_helpers.R file.
      \item
      Generalized \code{msg.warn()} / \code{msg.warn0()} and \code{msg()} /
      \code{msg0()} code.
      \item
      Internal C/C++ function \code{tmrWeightedInertiaDist()} made public as the R function \code{TraMineRInternalWeightedInertiaDist()}. (Used by package \code{Weightedcluster})

    }
}

\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqtrate()}: now accepts a sequence object (\code{seqdata} argument) containing only one sequence.
    \item
    \code{seqdist()}: now accepts a reference sequence object (\code{refseq} argument)
    containing missing values while the main sequence object (\code{seqdata} argument) doesn't.

}
}
\section{Changes in unreleased version 2.0-4 [2017-04-13]}{


\subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    Renamed several argument names to increase consistency within TraMineR and
    between TraMineR and R. The aim is also to have a common naming
    convention within TraMineR.
    A new internal function (\code{checkargs()})is used to guarantee
    backward compatibility. If the old argument name is used instead of the new
    one, a warning message with an explanation is displayed and the execution
    continues. If the new and old argument names are used together, an error
    message is displayed and the execution stops.
    The following functions have at least one renamed argument:
    \code{dissrep()}, \code{disstree()}, \code{disstree2dot()},
    \code{disstree2dotp()}, \code{disstreedisplay()}, \code{is.eseq()}, \code{is.seqelist()}, \code{seqdiff()},
    \code{seqeconstraint()}, \code{seqecontain()}, \code{seqecreate()}, \code{seqefsub()}, \code{seqeid()},
    \code{seqelength()}, \code{seqelength<-}, \code{seqetm()}, \code{seqeweight()}, \code{seqeweight<-},
    \code{seqlegend()}, \code{seqpcplot()}, \code{seqplot()}, \code{seqrep()}, \code{seqtab()}, \code{seqtrate()},

    \code{plot.stslist.statd()}, \code{plot.subseqelistchisq()}. \cr
    See the help page of each of
    these functions for the mapping between old and new argument names.

    \item
    Renamed function: \code{is.seqe()} was renamed as \code{is.eseq()}.

\subsection{Misc:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    Fixed an issue with an example in the documentation page of \code{seqpcplot()}.

  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqecreate()}: an error is thrown when events are not grouped
    by id in inputted TSE data. (Reported by Nicolas Jay).
    This requirement is now specified in \code{seqecreate} help page.
    }
}
\subsection{Misc:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    exported alias functions allowing other packages to access TraMineR
    internal functions (see \code{?TraMineRInternalLayout}).
    }
}
}

\section{Version 1.8-7}{

\subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: Suppressed unnecessary \code{output} argument. The
    \code{seqpcplot} object is automatically retrieved when using the
    assignment operator, e.g., \code{p <- seqepcplot(...)}.
    }
}
\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqformat()}: When converting from STS to TSE, an error was raised if the
    tevent matrix had empty strings (i.e. \code{""}). Now, this is considered as no event.
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: Fixed error that appeared at the use of \code{"_end"} events.
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: An error occurred when plotting a state sequence object
    (of class \code{stslist}) with a numeric \code{cnames} attribute.
    }
}
\subsection{Misc:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    Required packages \code{RColorBrewer} and \code{boot} now listed as \code{"imports"}
    in DESCRIPTION and using \code{import} in NAMESPACE.
    }
}
}

\section{Version 1.8-6}{

\subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqformat()}: new \code{nr} argument to specify the missing state
    symbol in SPS input.
    \item
    \code{disstreeleaf()}: new logical \code{label} argument to specify
    whether the leaf membership should be labelled with
    the classification rules.
    }
}
\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqtreedisplay()} and \code{disstreedisplay()}: GraphViz installer no longer
    adds GraphViz to the PATH environment variable. Therefore the two
    functions have been adapted to search for GraphViz. In case GraphViz
    would not be found, you can specify the GraphViz installation
    directory with the new \code{gvpath} argument.
    \item
    \code{disstree()} and \code{seqtree()}: removed the warning when \code{R} equals \code{0} or \code{1}  (no permutations).
    \item
    \code{seqformat()}: fixed a problem with missing states when converting
    from SPS to STS (see Changes in function above.)
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: fixed issues with \code{which} argument of \code{plot.seqpcplot}.
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: fixed issues with arguments \code{xlab} and \code{title}.
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: replaced a warning message by an error message at
    failures in finding plot positions for sequences. The error
    message advices to modify the (currently hidden) \code{maxit} argument.
    Additionally, automatically generated subtitles are now hidden
    when the argument \code{title} is used.
    \item
    \code{as.character.seqelist()}, \code{print.seqelist()}: fixed an issue with time
    display in event sequences which was in scientific notation for numbers
    with more than 2 digits. The function now uses the R format function and
    thus accounts for global formatting options such as \code{options(digits=)}
    and/or \code{options(scipen=)}.
    \item
    \code{seqtrate()}: fixed error with sequence objects having only two columns.
    }
}
\subsection{New functionalities:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{disstree2dot()} and \code{disstree2dotp()} gain a new argument called \code{title.outer}.
    If \code{title.outer=TRUE}, the title is printed in the outer margins.
    }
}
}

\section{Version 1.8-5}{

\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqefsub()}: reported support did not properly account for weights.
    \item
    \code{seqtreedisplay()}: corrected a bug when using representative sequences and
    a \code{dist} object was passed to the \code{dist.matrix} argument (reported by
    Emanuela Struffolino).
    \item
    \code{seqLLCS()} and \code{seqLLCP()}: added a check on the argument. Both sequences
    should belong to state sequence objects with a common alphabet.
    \item
    \code{seqpcplot()}: small change in default lower \code{ylim}.
    }
}
\subsection{Help pages:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    help pages updated with author and keyword fields.
    }
}
}

\section{Version 1.8-4}{

\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqrep()}, \code{dissrep()}, \code{seqrplot()}: wrong (unweighted) \code{"na"} values were returned;
    also quality measures \code{"MD"} (mean distance to representative) and \code{"V"}
    (discrepancy) were not computed properly when more than one representative
    selected (since version 1.8-2).
    }
}
\subsection{User invisible changes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    Added an internal function to fix an issue with an internal C level
    function when called from other packages.

    \item
    \code{seqdss()}: adding long state labels to returned sequence object.
    \item
    \code{seqplot()}: new option \code{type = "pc"}.
    \item
    \code{seqplot()}, \code{seqdplot()}, \code{seqiplot()}, \code{seqfplot()}, \code{seqmsplot()}, \code{seqrplot()}:
    if \code{density} and/or \code{angle} are used to produce shading lines
    instead of solid colors, the legend is plotted using the same
    parameters and thus corresponds to the colors/shades used in the plot.
    \item
    \code{seqplot()}: if \code{group} argument is a factor, the plots are
    now ordered the same way as the factor levels.
    \item
    \code{seqplot()}, \code{plot.stslist()}: if \code{sortv} is a factor, the
    sequences are now sorted according to the order of the factor levels.
    \item
    \code{seqmodst()} and \code{plot.stslist.modst()}: changed name of
    attribute \code{occurences} of object returned by \code{seqmodst} to
    \code{occurrences}. Made resulting changes in \code{plot.stslsit.modst}.
    }
}
\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqdef()}: When selecting subsets of sequence objects using \code{rownames}
    instead of row indexes, the corresponding weights were not selected.
    Fixed by setting (row)names of weight vector as the sequence
    \code{rownames}. (Alexis Gabadinho)
    }
}

}

\section{Version 1.8-2}{

\subsection{Vignettes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item

    }
}
\subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqtree()}, \code{disstree()}: speed improvements.
    \item
    \code{seqtm()}: gives a warning when state names or state labels contain a comma.
    \item
    \code{seqdef()}: changed the display of alphabet, state labels and long labels when
    creating a state sequence object.
    \item
    \code{seqistatd()} and \code{seqmeant()}: added \code{prop} argument to calculate
    proportions of time spent in
    each state instead of absolute values.
    \item
    \code{seqplot()} and aliases: \code{group} now also accepts as argument a list of
    variables/vectors and produces a plot for each combination of the
    values of the variables in the list.
    \item
    \code{dissrep()}, \code{seqrep()}, \code{seqrplot()}: now accounts for weights when present.
    \item
    \code{seqtrate()}, \code{seqsubm()}: added two arguments:
      \itemize{
        \item
        \code{lag}: compute transition rates from \eqn{t} to \eqn{t+}\code{lag}, set to one by default.
        \item
        \code{with.missing}: If \code{TRUE}, compute transition rates to and from missing values.
        }
    \item
    \code{seqtreedisplay()}: now overwrites previous file if filename is not \code{NULL}.
    Tree quality measures displayed with R code.
    \item
    \code{checktriangleineq()}: internal function to check triangle inequality is now
    in C, which allows checking much bigger distance matrices.
    \item
    \code{seqIplot()}, \code{seqiplot()} and \code{seqplot()} with type \code{"I"} or \code{"i"}: the \code{sortv} argument now also accepts a sorting method,
    namely one of \code{"from.start"} or \code{"from.end"}.
    See the help page \code{?plot.stslist} for explanation.
    \item
    \code{seqeconstraint()} and other \code{seqe...} functions for event sequences: support of subsequences can now be determined by means of any of
    Joshi's 5 counting methods (see the ref manual page). The method should be
    specified with \code{seqeconstraint()}.
    \item
    \code{seqeapplaysub()}: when \code{method=NULL} is specified (now the default), the count method assigned to the event sequence object is used. With \code{method="count"} CDIST_O (number of distinct occurrences) is used as previously.
    \item
    \code{seqrep()}: attribute \code{Index} of the returned object is now a vector instead of an object of class \code{dissrep}.
    }
}
\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqtreedisplay()}: was changing current directory when an error occurred in
    the plotting function.
    \item
    \code{dissrep()}, \code{seqrep()}: error when \code{nrep} cannot be reached (reported by M. Studer)
    \item
    \code{seqefsub()}: when using \code{strsubseq} argument, \code{countMethod} of \code{seqeconstraint} was not taken into account (Reported by Reto Bürgin).
    \item
    \code{seqeconstraint()}: added consistency checks to avoid misuses (Reported by Reto Bürgin).
    \item
    \code{print.seqelist()} and \code{as.character.seqelist()}: generated \code{segfault} when converting long event sequences to character (Reported by Pierre Molinier).
    \item
    \code{seqsubm()}: Very small rounding errors (\code{1e-16}) were sometimes leading to non symmetric substitution cost matrix (Reported by Alexandre Pollien).

    \code{seqformat()}: fixed problems with \code{fillblanks} argument when converting from SPELL to STS.
    \item
    \code{seqdist()} and \code{seqdistmc()}: \code{method="HAM"} did not account for the provided substitution cost matrix; it used 1 for all substitution costs (Reported by Florian Hertel).
    \item
    \code{seqdist()}: fixed a (possible) memory leak.
    \item
    \code{seqdss()}, \code{seqdur()}: fixed bad handling of missing values in several cases:

    \item
    \code{seqiplot()}, \code{seqIplot()}, \code{seqfplot()}: changed the automatic setting of the x-axis length, to ensure identical lengths of the x-axis when the maximal sequence length differs between groups (reported by M. Studer).
    \item
    \code{seqplot()} and aliases: fixed error with \code{xaxis} argument.
    \item
    \code{seqtransn()}: the returned normalized number of transitions for
    sequences of length 1 was \code{NaN} (value of \code{transn.norm=0/seqlength-1}). Now set to 0.
    \item
    \code{seqici()}: returns now correctly 0 instead of \code{NaN} for sequences of length 1.
    }
}
\subsection{Changes in existing functions:}{

}
}

\section{Version 1.6-2}{

\subsection{Bug fixes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqdef()}: now checks whether all states encountered in the input data are present in an optional user provided alphabet (\code{state} argument)
    \item
    \code{seqefsub()}: The support of a subsequence with a total support of 1 was set to 0 (hence, this only applies if the minimum support is 1.) This is now corrected (Reported by Anna Hera).
    \item
    Corrected compilation problems under SOLARIS (Reported by Prof Brian Ripley).

    and P. Jeuniaux).
    \item
    \code{seqsubm()}:
    \itemize{
      \item
      When \code{method="TRATE"}, the substitution costs are now based on the value of \code{cval}: \eqn{SC(i,j) = cval -P(i,j) - P(j,i)} where \eqn{P(i,j)} is the transition rate from state \eqn{i} to \eqn{j}.
      \item
      added a new \code{transition} argument to use only transition from \code{"previous"} or \code{"next"} state
      instead of the default \code{"both"} when \code{time.varying = TRUE}.
      \item
      Now, by default \code{cval} equals 2, unless \code{transition} is set to \code{both} and
      \code{time.varying} is \code{TRUE} in which case \code{cval} equals 4.

    \item
    \code{seqfplot()} / \code{plot.stslist.freq()} and \code{seqdplot()} / \code{plot.stslist.statd()}:
      when weights are used, i.e. when the \code{weighted=TRUE} argument is passed

      \item
      in the output object, name of the attribute containing
       statistics for the representative set changed from \code{Quality}
       to \code{Statistics} and that of the attribute containing the
       overall quality measure changed from \code{rindex} to \code{Quality}.

    }
}

    \item
    \code{seqfplot()}:

      \itemize{
        \item
        new \verb{yaxis} option: with \code{yaxis="cum"} (default) cumulated percentages

    This can be disabled with \code{yaxis=FALSE}.
    }
}

   \itemize{
      \item

}
\subsection{New classes and methods:}{

    \item
    new class \code{stslist.statd} for objects produced by the \code{seqstatd()} function
    and methods for printing and plotting such objects.
    \item
    new class \code{stslist.freq} for objects produced by \code{seqtab()} function and

    \item
    \code{disscenter()}: new \code{medoid.index} argument to get the indexes of all
    medoids (rather than only the first one).

    \item
    New generic function \code{plot.stlist()} with option \code{type=} for
    plotting state sequence objects of class \code{ststlist} created by
    the \code{seqdef()} function. Old functions \code{seqdplot()}, \code{seqfplot()},
    \code{seqiplot()}, \code{seqmtplot()} work as in the previous version but by
    calling \code{plot.stslist} with the appropriate \code{type=} option
    (types are \code{'d'}, \code{'f'}, \code{'i'} and \code{'mt'}). However, the order of the
    functions' arguments may have changed and this may cause problems
    if the names of the arguments were not explicitly specified in your
    scripts (which is inadvisable anyway).
    }
}
\subsection{Changes in the dissimilarity and discrepancy analysis diss module:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{dissreg()} is renamed to \code{dissmfac()} for multi-factor dissimilarity analysis.

    \item
    \code{seqdur()}
    \item
    \code{seqST()}
    }
}
\subsection{Changes in the computation of distances between sequences:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{seqdist()} now checks if substitution costs respect the triangle inequality.
    When this is the case it ensures that the resulting dissimilarity matrix
    also respects the triangle inequality.
    \item
    New options for selecting the distance normalization method.
    \item
    New reversed LCP, i.e. longest common suffix method. (\code{method="RLCP"})
    }
}
\subsection{Various changes:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    CITATION file added.
    \item
    \code{seqST()} caused an error when run with more than 12 states: bug fixed.

  \itemize{
    \item
    \code{dissassoc()}: Computes association with a factor;
    \item
    \code{dissreg()}: Regression analysis of a dissimilarity matrix;

  \itemize{
    \item
    New \code{group} option allowing to draw several plots for the levels
    of a factor within a single command;
    \item
    TraMineR now uses \code{layout} for controlling the position of the
    plots and the legend in the graphic area. This is not compatible
    with \code{par(mfrow=...)}. To use the standard \code{par(mfrow=...)} method,
    one must set the \code{use.layout=FALSE} option in the plot functions;
    \item
    \code{seqmtplot()}: new function that plots the mean time spent in each state;
    \item
    Option \code{withborder=FALSE} is now obsolete and replaced by the standard \code{border=NA} option.
    }
}

\subsection{Changes in event sequence (seqe) module:}{

    \item
    \code{seqecreate} now accepts state sequences and performs automatic conversion (\code{seqecreate})
    \item
    Time constraints are now implemented separately and are stored with the results (\code{seqeconstraint})
    }
}
\subsection{Changes in the seqformat() function:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
    New options for importing SPELL formatted data.
    \item
    The STS internal and the output in STS, SPS or DSS formats are now by
    default in extended format (a matrix with one state per column) instead of
    compressed format (a character string).
    Use the \code{compressed=TRUE} option to get an output in the compressed format
    (sequences as character strings).
    \item
    \code{"SPS1"} and \code{"SPS2"} formats are now replaced by the generic \code{"SPS"} format with
    options \code{SPS.in} and \code{SPS.out} for defining the separator and surrounding
    characters used for specifying the state/duration couples.
    }
}
\subsection{Other new functions:}{
  \itemize{
    \item
