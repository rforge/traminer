              CHANGES IN WeightedCluster VERSION 1.2
NEW FEATURES
  o as.clustrange(), wcKMedRange(): Added bootstrap of cluster quality measures.
  o wcCmpCluster(): Automatically compute different clustering solutions and associated quality measures to help identifying the best one.
  o as.clustrange(), wcKMedRange(): Speed and memory handling improvements.

BUG FIXES
  o wcKMedRange() was internally converting dist objects to matrix. For this reason, it used too much memory. This isn't the case anymore.
  o Moved the vignettes source to the vignettes folder.

  o seqclustname: automatic labeling of clusters using sequence medoids.

  o Now testing for correct input in "as.clustrange".

BUG FIXES
  o PBC, HG, HC, where computed only on the lower triangular part of the distance matrix (instead on the whole one).
