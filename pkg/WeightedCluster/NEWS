              CHANGES IN WeightedCluster VERSION 1.2
NEW FEATURES
  o as.clustrange(), wcKMedRange(): Added bootstrap of cluster quality measures.
  o wcCmpCluster(): Automatically compute different clustering solutions and associated quality measures to help identifying the best one.
  o as.clustrange(), wcKMedRange(): Speed and memory handling improvements.

BUG FIXES
  o wcKMedRange() was internally converting dist objects to matrix. For this reason, it used too much memory. This isn't the case anymore.  
  o Moved the vignettes source to the vignettes folder.

NEW FEATURES
  o The vignette (English version) has been published in the LIVES Working papers series.
  o The vignette (manual) has been translated in English.
  o seqclustname: automatic labeling of clusters using sequence medoids.
  o Added the WeightedCluster vignette (in French).
  o It is now possible to plot the "RHC" statistic computed as 1-HC. This way all statistics should be maximized (Requested by Gilbert Ritschard).
  o It is now possible to specify the colors used by plot.clustrange (Requested by Sandra Ham).
  o Now testing for correct input in "as.clustrange".

BUG FIXES
  o PBC, HG, HC, where computed only on the lower triangular part of the distance matrix (instead on the whole one).
  o Corrected citation informations
  o Many grammar and spelling corrections in the WeightedClusterPreview vignette (thanks to Nevena Zhelyazkova).
  
			  CHANGES IN WeightedCluster VERSION 0.9
