\title{
Definition of an events to states matrix.
}
\description{
This function creates a matrix specifying for each state (given in row) to which state we fall when the event given in column happens.
}
\usage{
seqe2stm(events, dropMatrix = NULL, dropList = NULL, firstState = "None")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{events}{Character. The vector of all possible events.}
  \item{dropMatrix}{Logical matrix. Specifying the events to forget once a given event has occurred.}
  \item{dropList}{List. Same as \code{dropMatrix} but using a list (often more convenient).}
  \item{firstState}{Character. Name of the first state, before any event has occurred.}
}

\details{
This function creates a matrix with in each cell the new state which results when the column event (column name) occurs while we are in the corresponding row state (row name). Such a matrix is required by \code{\link{TSE_to_STS}}.
By default, a new state is created for each combination of events that already has occurred.

\code{dropMatrix} and \code{dropList} allow to specify which events should be "forgotten" once a given event has occurred.
For instance, we may want to forget the "marriage" event once the event "divorce" has occurred.

\code{dropMatrix} specifies for each event given in row, the previous events, given in column that should be forgotten.
\code{dropList} uses a list to specify the same thing. The form is list(event1=c(..., events to forget), event2=c(..., events to forget)).
See example below.
}
\value{
A matrix.
}
\note{This function is a pre-release and further testing is still needed, please report any problems.}

\examples{
## Achieving same result using dropMatrix or dropList.
## List of possible events.
events <- c("marr", "child", "div")
dm <- matrix(FALSE, 3,3, dimnames=list(events, events))
dm[3, ] <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
dm[1, 3] <- TRUE
## Using the matrix, we forget "marriage" and "child" events when "divorce" occurs.
## We also forget "divorce" after "marriage" occurs.
print(dm)
stm <- seqe2stm(events, dropMatrix=dm)

## Get same result with the dropList argument.
stmList <- seqe2stm(events, dropList=list("div"=c("marr", "child"), "marr"="div"))

## test that the results are the same
all.equal(stm, stmList)
