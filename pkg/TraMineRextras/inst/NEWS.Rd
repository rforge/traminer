\section{Changes in version 0.2.3 [2015-01-27]}{
\subsection{New functions}{
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{seqtabstocc()}: frequencies of state co-occurrence patterns}
}}
\subsection{Changes in existing functions}{
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{seqgranularity()}: new method \code{"mostfreq"}}
    \item{\code{seqedplot()}: replaced calls of TraMineR internal functions \code{seqeage}
        and \code{TraMineR.legend} with respectively
        \code{TraMineRInternalSeqeage} and \code{TraMineRInternalLegend}
        (should be transparent to the end user).}

\section{Changes in version 0.2.2 [2013-10-30]}{
\itemize{
    \item{Fixed issue with calling Rinternals from within extern "C" {}
        in seqstart.cpp (request of B. Ripley)}
}
}
\section{Changes in version 0.2.1 [2013-03-15]}{
\subsection{General}{
  \itemize{
    \item{NEWS is now in Rd format into inst/NEWS.Rd}
}}
\subsection{Bug Fixes}{
  \itemize{
    \item{
    \code{FCE_to_TSE()}: Events were not properly chronologically sorted.}
    \item{
    \code{TSE_to_STS()}: produced inconsistent results when events were not chronologically
    sorted by cases.}
}}}
\section{Changes in version 0.2 [2012-12-06]}{
\subsection{General}{
  \itemize{
    \item{
    First release on CRAN}
}}
\subsection{Changes in existing functions}{
  \itemize{
    \item{
    \code{seqplot.tentrop()} and \code{seqplot.tentrop.m()}: new argument \code{cex.legend}
        for controlling legend scaling factor.}
    \item{
    \code{seqentrans()}: new option \code{avg.occ}; when set as \code{TRUE} the table is
        completed with average number of occurrences of the subsequences
        in each sequence. The latter differs from the support for
        counting methods other than COBJ. Requires TraMineR 1.8-5 or higher.}
    \item{
    \code{dissvar.grp()} and \code{seqrep.grp()} now also accept distance objects as \code{mdis} argument.}
    \item{
    \code{group.p} has now a \code{weights} argument.}
}}
\subsection{Bug Fixes}{
  \itemize{
    \item{
    \code{seqedist()}: fixed a mix between norm and interval arguments.}
    \item{
    fixed build warning generated by calls of foreign functions.}
}}}
