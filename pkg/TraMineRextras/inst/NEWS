                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.5.3 [2018-02-02] (Development version)

Misc
    o   Function seqeordplot() suppressed. It is superseded by the
        function seqpcplot() of the TraMineR package.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.4.2 [2018-02-01]

New functions
    o   seqprecarity(): computes the sequence precarity index from
        a provided partial state order. The index is a
        corrected complexity index. See documentation page.
    o   seqprecorr(): determines the correction factor used by
        seqprecarity().
    o   seqprecstart(): determines the starting precarity level
        of the sequence from the partial state order.
    o   seqsurv(): fits survival curves for states in state sequences.
        There is a plot method for objects returned by seqsurv().
    o   seqsplot(): specific version of the TraMineR seqplot() function
        to plotting survival curves of states in sequences.

Changes in existing functions
    o   seqrep.grp() renamed argument names for consistency with TraMineR.
    o   seqrep.grp(): when 'diss=NULL', the dissimilarity matrix is now
        computed by calling seqdist with the 'method' and possibly
        related parameters specified among the '...' arguments.
        An error is raised when 'diss=NULL' and no 'method' is provided.

Bug fixes
    o   seqtabstocc(): label synchronization issue.

Misc
    o   Uses function \code{TraMineR.check.depr.args()} introduced
        in TraMineR v 2.0-8. So, depends now on version >= 2.0-8.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.4.1 [2017-08-16]

Changes in existing functions
    o   STS_to_SPELL(): Deleted. Converting to the "SPELL" format is now a
        feature of seqformat() in TraMineR 2.0-6+.
    o   seqrep.grp(): Added argument 'with.missing' to allow computing
        the default distances (when diss = NULL) for sequences with
        missing values.

Misc
    o   Replaced deprecated argument names in example of seqrep.grp().
    o   Now imports from RColorBrewer, survival, and cluster instead of
        depending on those packages.
    o   Suppressed unused import from combinat.
    o   ini.c file.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.4.0 [2017-05-13]

Note
    o   TraMineRextras has been adapted to and requires now TraMineR 2.0-5+.

Bug Fixes
    o   TSE_to_STS(): Latest sequences were not converted.

Changes in existing functions
    o   seqplot.rf(), seqplot.tentrop(), seqrep.grp(), dissvar.grp(),
        plot.seqimplic(): adjusted argument names (e.g., main, with.legend,
        legend.pos, diss, ...) to conform to the TraMineR 2 naming convention.

Misc
    o   seqrep.grp(): Removed 'with.missing=TRUE' in a help example as biofam.seq
        doesn't contain missing values and to conform to TraMineR 2.0-5+.
    o   seqeformat(), seqentrans(), seqerulesdisc(): Renamed 'seqe' to 'eseq'
        in internal code to conform to TraMineR 2.0-5+.
    o   Adjusted examples in help files to conform to TraMineR 2.0-5+.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2.6 [2017-03-01]

Misc

    o   Function ctplot() suppressed. It is superseded by the
        function seqpcplot() of the TraMineR package.
    o   C++ routines are now registered.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2.5 [2016-11-10]

New functions

    o   seqimplic(): Identifies position wise typical states
        of groups of sequences when compared with all the others. There
        are also plot and print methods for the outcome of the function.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2.4 [2015-07-23]

New functions

    o   seqplot.rf(): Implements the Relative Frequency Sequence Plots
        introduced in Fasang and Liao (2014).

Misc

    o   revised help page for seqemlt() (distance of Rousset et al. 2012)

    o   Added required basic packages to the import statements to
        comply with R v3.3 requirements.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2.3 [2015-01-27]

New functions

    o   seqtabstocc(): frequencies of state co-occurrence patterns

Changes in existing functions

    o   seqgranularity(): new method "mostfreq"

    o   seqedplot(): replaced calls of TraMineR internal functions seqeage
        and TraMineR.legend with respectively
        TraMineRInternalSeqeage and TraMineRInternalLegend
        (should be transparent to the end user).


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2.2 [2013-10-30]

    o   Fixed issue with calling Rinternals from within extern "C" {}
        in seqstart.cpp (request of B. Ripley)


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2.1 [2013-03-15]

General

    o   NEWS now uses basic formatting rules and is saved as inst/NEWS

Bug Fixes

    o   FCE_to_TSE(): Events were not properly chronologically sorted.

    o   TSE_to_STS(): produced inconsistent results when events were
        not chronologically sorted by cases.


                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2 [2012-12-06]

General:

    o   First release on CRAN

Changes in existing functions:

    o   seqplot.tentrop() and seqplot.tentrop.m(): new argument 'cex.legend'
        for controlling legend scaling factor.

    o   seqentrans(): new option 'avg.occ'; when set as TRUE the table is
        completed with average number of occurrences of the subsequences
        in each sequence. The latter differs from the support for
        counting methods other than COBJ. Requires TraMineR 1.8-5 or higher.

    o   dissvar.grp() and seqrep.grp() now also accept distance object as
        'mdis' argument.

    o   group.p has now a 'weights' argument.

Bug Fixes

    o   seqedist(): fixed a mix between norm and interval arguments.

    o   fixed build warning generated by calls of foreign functions.
