                CHANGES IN TraMineRextras VERSION 0.2 [2012-12-06]

General:

    o   First release on CRAN

Changes in existing functions:

    o   seqplot.tentrop() and seqplot.tentrop.m(): new argument 'cex.legend'
        for controlling legend scaling factor.

    o   seqentrans(): new option 'avg.occ'; when set as TRUE the table is
        completed with average number of occurrences of the subsequences
        in each sequence. The latter differs from the support for
        counting methods other than COBJ. Requires TraMineR 1.8-5 or higher.

    o   dissvar.grp() and seqrep.grp() now also accept distance object as
        'mdis' argument.

    o   group.p has now a 'weights' argument.

Bug Fixes

    o   seqedist(): fixed a mix between norm and interval arguments.

    o   fixed build warning generated by calls of foreign functions.
