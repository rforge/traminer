Changes in version 0.2 [2012-12-06]

    - First release on CRAN

Changes in existing functions

    - seqplot.tentrop() and seqplot.tentrop.m(): new argument cex.legend
        for controlling legend scaling factor.
    - seqentrans(): new option avg.occ; when set as TRUE the table is 
        completed with average number of occurrences of the subsequences 
        in each sequence. The latter differs from the support for 
        counting methods other than COBJ. Requires TraMineR 1.8.5 or higher.
    - dissvar.grp() and seqrep.grp() now also accept distance object as mdis
      argument.
    - group.p has now a weights argument.

Bug Fixes

    - seqedist(): fixed a mix between norm and interval arguments.
    - fixed build warning generated by calls of foreign functions.
